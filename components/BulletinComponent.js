              Due to the rising Covid-19 cases, the latest mandates, and the
              growing concern for our community, our main administration office
              is currently open for essential tasks only. These include design
              applications, escrow demands and documents, and legal ledgers.
              Please call or email us for any other tasks during this time and
              we will be happy to assist you. Assessments can be dropped off in
              the after-hours box next to the main office door or paid with card
              over the phone. We will not be issuing ID cards, conducting hall
              rentals, selling tickets, offering lap swim, or having any
              recreational activities during this time. Contact us at
              (808)674-4444 or email association@villagesofkapolei.com
